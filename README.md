# Generation-of-medical-data
This work is dedicated to the _creation_, _anonymization_ and _hacking_ of data.

## Parts:
1. **CreateData.py** - Creates realistic data on visits to the clinic.
2. **Anonymity.py** - Anonymizes data.
3. **Decode.py** - Trying to crack the encrypted data by hashcat and figure out the salt.

## Notes:
- You should change ***anonymity*** from pycanon to get k_arr (it's not hard)
- In Documentation folder folder you will find more detailed reports on each of the items above [RUS].
